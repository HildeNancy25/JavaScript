/*JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

1. Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
2. Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
3. Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
4. Writing into the browser console, using console.log(). */

console.log("hello, today is my fav day of the weekend"); // this display a message on the browser.
//document.write(84-10); this sould only be used for testing because it will delete the whole html elemnts to return 74
//window.alert("would you mind to close this window"); this can be used maybe for displaying a message on click

//TO GET DATA FROM USER

//document.getElementById(myName).innerHTML = "hello, how are you doing today?";
